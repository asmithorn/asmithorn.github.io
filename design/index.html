        <h2>Illinois State University</h2>
        <p>Redesigning the flagship site, including the incorporation of all the admissions information into the main site was a large-scale, multi-year effort by Web &amp; Interactive Communications. The project team consisted of several content strategists, developers, and designers. In my role as the lead designer I created the overall look and feel, met with constituents across campus, wrote the new user-interface, and managed the team of designers during the implementation phase.</p>

        <h2>College of Fine Arts</h2>
        <p>Upgrading the College of Fine Arts from fixed width, multi-domain websites maintained through Adobe Contribute to a single mobile-first responsive layout on the University content management system was a year-long project by Web &amp; Interactive Communications. The project team consisted of myself, a content strategist, and representatives from the Dean's Office. In my role as the designer I created the overall look and feel, worked with constituents throughout the college, coordinated photography, and implemented the front-end user-interface.</p>

          <p>A local campaign originally created by WGLT and the ISU Sustainability Office. In my role as the lead designer, I developed the logo for the campaign and all supplementary branded materials. Since 2011 the yearly challenge grew beyond the campus resources and was taken on by the Town of Normal.</p>
