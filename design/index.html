        <h2>Illinois State Design System</h2>
        <p>Since the fall of 2018, my top priority has been leading the development of a design system to unify the digital experience across the University. The first public release was in July 2019. I have continue to serve as the product owner as the system expands to a wider campus audience and is maintained among an increasingly larger team of designers, engineers, and content strategists.</p>

        <h2>User Flows</h2>
        <p>Logging in and logging out of systems at Illinois State were made more complex as the technical teams incorporated multi-factor authentication. After being added to the project to create visual designs for a few screens, I quickly assessed the need for mapping out user flows for these processes to reveal pain points, visual needs, content needs, and provide clear artifacts for decision-making for leadership.</p>

        <h2>User Personas</h2>
        <p>As the spread of design thinking and user experience spreads across departments at Illinois State University, user persona development has increased. More digital products and websites are utilizing personas as a tool during the discovery phase of product development, allowing clients to move out of the abstract and focus on specific segments with their visuals and messaging. I have created user personas for several projects on campus, this illustrates one used for assessing vendor products for a new IT Help portal.</p>

        <h2>Workshop Facilitation</h2>
        <p>As digital strategy and marketing has evolved over the years to requiring specific goals and actions for people using websites and products, finding the why has become a necessary step in the discoverability process. These Post-Its illustrate a facilitation session I lead with printmaking faculty for a rebrand of Normal Editions. The workshop utilized a note and vote system to have the faculty quickly brainstorm and come to a consensus with the brand voice and tone before moving into a visual ideation phase.</p>

        <h2>Normal Editions</h2>
        <p>Rebranding and updating Normal Editions from their original website created several decades ago to a mobile-first responsive layout on the University content management system was a two year-long project by Web &amp; Interactive Communications. The project team consisted of a content strategist, several developers, several designers, and the faculty in Normal Editions. In my role as the lead designer I worked closely with the faculty to create a logo, separate from their printmaking chop, and the overall look and feel of the website. Quickly during the implementation phase of the website, several key components were identified as needing new development solutions, as well as coordinating a team effort in building out the long history of artwork from the print shop.</p>
